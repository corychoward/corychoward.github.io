      <description>Data Introduction In this project I will be using an NFL betting dataset I found from kaggle. From that dataset I created this one which includes every game from the 2016 season. A little betting terminology knowledge is necessary for understanding this data. The game &amp;quot;spread&amp;quot; is how much a team is expected to win by, the &amp;quot;over/under line&amp;quot; is how many total points are expected to be scored by both teams combined in a game.</description>
