# Beaver body temperature

I scrolled through the list of datasets in R looking for a fun one to use for this post, settled on this dataset because I saw a video of a beaver earlier today and he was very cute. The output gives us the mean body temperature (in degrees Celsius) over the period of a day for the beaver studied in this data.

```{R}
library(boot)
head(beaver1)
beav <- beaver1
```

```{python}
r.beav.temp.mean()
done="Just finished my last assignment as an undergrad at UT! Hook em!"
print(done)
```
