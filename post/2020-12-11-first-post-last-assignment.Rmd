# Connecting R and Python

In this post I'll be showing how we are able to take a dataset from R and create an output in python.

```{R}
library(boot)
head(beaver1)
beav <- beaver1
```

I scrolled through the list of datasets in R looking for a fun one to use for this post, settled on this dataset because I saw a video of a beaver earlier today and he was very cute. I saved this dataset in R.
```{python}
r.beav.temp.mean()
```

After saving the dataset in R we can send it to python using the "r." function. The output gives us the mean body temperature (in degrees Celsius) over the period of a day for the beaver studied in this data.

```{R}
library(reticulate)
fin <- "Just finished my last assignment as an undergrad at UT!"
```

We are also able to combine functions from R into python using reticulate.
```{python}
ished="Hook em!"
print(r.fin,ished)
```
